/**
 * Hook to handle Apple sign-in on iOS.

 * This hook will check if the user is already authenticated, and if not,
 * it will prompt the user to sign-in with Apple.
 *
 * If the user is authenticated, it will return the `idToken` from the authentication response.
 *
 * If the user is not authenticated, it will throw an `AppleSignInError`.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to an object with the following properties:
 * - `identityToken`: The authentication token returned by Apple.
 * - `nonce`: The nonce returned by Apple.
 * - `fullName`: full name returned from Apple.
